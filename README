THIS CODE IS BETA QUALITY

NOTE: If you're on PlugApps Linux, install the beta with "pacman -Sy plugui".

For everyone else:

Step 1: clone the git tree: "cd /opt; git clone git://github.com/plugapps/PlugUI.git " 

	(if you wish to help with development, fork the tree on github instead and clone your own tree so you can commit and we can pull from you)

Step 2: run the setup script "/opt/PlugUI/setup.sh"

	you will be asked to make a username during this process, this will be the main username you use to login to the web ui

Step 3: visit plugfinder.appspot.com to help you find your plug on the local network, click the link, then enter the username you created earlier when asked.
